                        <p class="sentence1">Bob and Sheila, owner-operators of Paradise Connections Yacht Charters, are experienced sailors whose goal is to assist you in finding the best boat for your charter yacht sailing vacation.</p>
                        <p class="sentence1 haha">Bob grew up around boats in Southern California, while Sheila's only boating experience was riding a ferry a couple of times. We met, got married and went to France in 1980. We lived on a p√©niche (French barge) for a few years
                            on the Seine river outside of Paris. This is where we got the boat-building bug.</p>
                        <p class="sentence1">After building a few dinghies and a kayak, we decided to tackle a large project -- a 26-foot liveaboard sailboat. Within six months we were living aboard Loose Moose on the Marne river east of Paris.</p>

                        our friends and neighbors.</p>
